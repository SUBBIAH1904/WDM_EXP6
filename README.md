### AIM: To implement Information Retrieval Using Vector Space Model in Python.
### Description: 
<div align = "justify">
Implementing Information Retrieval using the Vector Space Model in Python involves several steps, including preprocessing text data, constructing a term-document matrix, 
calculating TF-IDF scores, and performing similarity calculations between queries and documents. Below is a basic example using Python and libraries like nltk and 
sklearn to demonstrate Information Retrieval using the Vector Space Model.

### Procedure:
1. Define sample documents.
2. Preprocess text data by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and punctuation.
3. Construct a TF-IDF matrix using TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.
4. Define a search function that calculates cosine similarity between a query and documents based on the TF-IDF matrix.
5. Execute a sample query and display the search results along with similarity scores.

### Program:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import string

# Sample documents
documents = [
    "This is the first document.",
    "This document is the second document.",
    "And this is the third one.",
    "Is this the first document?",
]

# Preprocessing function to tokenize and remove stopwords/punctuation
def preprocess_text(text):
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stopwords.words("english") and token not in string.punctuation]
    return " ".join(tokens)
    print(tokens)

# Preprocess documents
preprocessed_docs = [preprocess_text(doc) for doc in documents]

# Construct TF-IDF matrix
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf_matrix = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(preprocessed_docs)


# Calculate cosine similarity between query and documents
def search(query, tfidf_matrix, tfidf_vectorizer):
    preprocessed_query = preprocess_text(query)
    query_vector = tfidf_vectorizer.transform([preprocessed_query])

    # Calculate cosine similarity between query and documents
    similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(query_vector, tfidf_matrix)

    # Sort documents based on similarity scores
    sorted_indexes = similarity_scores.argsort()[0][::-1]

    # Return sorted documents along with their similarity scores
    results = [(documents[i], similarity_scores[0, i]) for i in sorted_indexes]
    return results
# Example query
query =input("Enter query: ")

# Perform search
search_results = search(query, tfidf_matrix, tfidf_vectorizer)

# Display search results
i=1
for result in search_results:
    print("----------------------")
    print("\nRank: ",i)
    print("Document:", result[0])
    print("Similarity Score:", result[1])

    i=i+1
```
### Output:
![image](https://github.com/21005984/WDM_EXP6/assets/94748389/eaea3a2e-9317-4e73-83f2-d8153afef6d5)

### Result:
Thus, the implementation of Information Retrieval Using Vector Space Model in Python is executed successfully.
